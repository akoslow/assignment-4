         <h2>2021 NBA Draft: What Will the Spurs Do With the 12th Pick?</h2>
       </div>
     </section>

     <section class="intro">
       <p class="one">The Spurs youth movement is now in full effect! After years of seeing Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili taking the court, the reigns are now being handed over to the likes of Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, and Keldon Johnson.</p>

       <p class="two">There's a lot to like about this young core, but after two-straight years of missing the playoffs for the first time in team history, it's obvious there is a lot of room to grow. For the 2021 NBA Draft, the Spurs will be picking 12th overall. What are thier options and who should fans me looking out for on draft night?</p>

      <h3 class="Johnson">Jalen Johnson: 6'9 Forward, Duke</h3>
      <p class="johnson-report-1"> There's no secret the Spurs need help on the wing. With Demar Derozan and Rudy Gay most likely leaving in free agency, the team needs someone to take the load off the bench. Johnson could be that guy.</p>
      <p class="johnson-report-2"> A top-rated prospect coming out of Duke, Johnson failed to live up to expectations. In just 13 games, he averaged 11.2 points per game, 6.1 rebounds, and 2.2 assists. That being said, there is still a ton of untapped potential for the 19 year-old and the Spurs could be the perfect spot to help him reach it.</p>
      <p class="johnson-report-3"> Johnson has a long wingspan that can help him on the wing on both offense and defense. He's got a scorers mentality and could be an asset off the bench or slid into the starting lineup late in the season. If the Spurs do take Johnson at 12, expect him to see some time in the G-League with the Austin Spurs in order for him to get as much playing experience as possible</p>

      <h3 class="jones">Kai Jones: 6'11 Center, Texas</h3>
      <p class="jones-1"> Current center Jakob Poeltl had a career year for San Antonio averging 8.6 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. Pop and the front office seem to have Poeltl in their future plans, but his athletic shortcomings hinder him as a reliable center that can be a force in today's NBA. That's where Texas center Kai Jones comes in. Very unpolished but athleticism isn't something he lacks</p>
      <p class=jones-2> Over two years at Texas, Jones averaged only 6.2 points and 4.0 rebounds in just 19.7 minutes per game. This isn't the production you want to see from a potential lottery pick, but just like Johnson, the potential is there. He needs to improve on the boards and be more consistent on the offensive end but he's got the build and the tools to be a featured center on this Spurs team for a long time.</p>
